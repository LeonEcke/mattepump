# MattePump

## What is this?

MattePump is a hacked together python script for generating low grade math quizes that are output as a .pdf

## How to use?

Right now you have to go in and change the hardcoded values to change the output. In the future you will have a better interface for it.

## Epic

I see a single executable os agnostic program which will allow users to create math sheets quickly and easily via a GUI. They will be able to select which basic mathmatic operands (+, -, *, /) that will be used, how many arguments per math question, how many questions per sheet, and if they want a cheatsheet. This will be output to a PDF file. 

## Licences

This project is licenced under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license (as seen in /LICENCE). All worksheets generated using MattePump also use this licence.

### What that means

The best explenation is (here)[https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en].

The Tl;Dr of the Tl;Dr is: You must credit MattePump as the origin of any derrived work. You **may not** use MattePump for any commercial use (you cant sell the sheets generated with MattePump). Any derrived work must use a "compliant license" (like for example, the same license).

### Why Non Commercial

The school system in my northern european country of birth is stuggling. There's a deficit of teachers, and those who are around are overworked and underpayed. They don't get enough time for their legaly protected breaks thoughout the day, let alone enough time to prepare unique worksheets or other fun/useful activities for their students.

This has created a market where other people create these low-effort shovelware worksheets that they then sell for 1-2 Euro a piece. These costs are too low for teachers to bother applying for a purcace through their schools budget, and instead just puy it out of pocket, becuase it's fast and they are overworked.

**This is absolutely disgusting.** It's exploitation of one of the most important workforces in our society. I refuse to take any part of this, and I will not have my work perverted to let anyone else expoilt teachers using it. 

Therefore I chose to licence this in a way to explicitly forbid the selling of any material created using MattePump or any remix of MattePump.
