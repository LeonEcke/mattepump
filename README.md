# MattePump

## What is this?

MattePump is a hacked together python script for generating low grade math quizes that are output as a .pdf

## How to use?

Right now you have to go in and change the hardcoded values to change the output. In the future you will have a better interface for it.

## Epic

I see a single executable os agnostic program which will allow users to create math sheets quickly and easily via a GUI. They will be able to select which basic mathmatic operands (+, -, *, /) that will be used, how many arguments per math question, how many questions per sheet, and if they want a cheatsheet. This will be output to a PDF file.

The Tl;Dr of the Tl;Dr is: You must credit MattePump as the origin of any derrived work. You **may not** use MattePump for any commercial use (you cant sell the sheets generated with MattePump). Any derrived work must use a "compliant license" (like for example, the same license).
